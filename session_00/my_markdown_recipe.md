Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients
1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
1 cup (220g) packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups (340g) chocolate chips
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.
Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes.
Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
Enjoy your homemade classic chocolate chip cookies!
